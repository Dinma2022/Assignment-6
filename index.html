                    a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    the next 12 weeks was the best- and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing
                    the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer
                    at a VR startup. "

                <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended</h3>
                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
                    code. i needed some structure from professionals who
                    can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                    enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                    about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                    They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                    The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                    to the next levelin a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
                    often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                    after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"

                <p>" The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find really refreshing.
                    The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
                    myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
